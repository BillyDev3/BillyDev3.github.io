        <h1>Jack "Billy" Devenish</h1>
        <p>Jack Francis Francis Devenish, known as "Billy" within the music scene, is albino. There is a very small amount of color within his body, 
        creating a very bright, gastly tone. He is capable on the guitar, piano, and most classical stringed instruments. Not that this matters, though.
         He gets no bitches</p>
